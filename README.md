# nodeRockPaperScissorsCollab
A collaborative project to learn the ins-and-outs of Node, and GitHub.

In this project, me and three other software engineers took time to collaborate on learning Node.js, as well as the collaborative process and tools available on github.

We chose to make a simple rock-paper-scissors project, but ensured that the descision making and win deterimination was processed on the server side.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, and GitHub

After meeting at 100Devs, we endeavored to expand our knowledge of Node.js by making descisions and calculations on the server side of this app.  We also chose to collaborate by use of the service GitHub.  This allowed us to learn and refine our knowledge of the service, that we could not have done as solo software engineers.

## Optimizations

In the end, we were able to achieve our primary goal of server side rock-paper-scissors.  Future expansions may include:

- Optimization of code for readability
- A cleaner UX/UI on the served html file
- A replacement of the text box, with buttons

## Lessons Learned:

Of the most important things all four of us learned, was the use of Node.js to make a server that can return html, as well as process the logic of the game.

But even more important was the collaborative process itself.  All of us learned more about github than we could have done solo.
